Normal instructions: The PC gets incremented in the cycle the instruction register DOESN'T get loaded.

The I/O address is stable for two cycles; the strobe is active for only one cycle.

The output data is stable for two cycles, like the I/O address.

With a jump, call or return, obviously the new address must be ready at the end of the second cycle, so the
next instruction gets loaded properly. Since even the incremented PC is not ready before that, the loaded PC probably
isn't either.
