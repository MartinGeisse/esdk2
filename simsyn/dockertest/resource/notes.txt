docker save {image}
docker load {file}

use this to send the image to somebody without having a docker hub account.

can invoke a code generator just by calling its docker image manually.


I/O:
- copying files in/out of containers is preferred as a long-term solution because the individual generator apps don't
    have to deal with it then.
- it is more complex though, and short-term it is easier to transfer ZIP files
