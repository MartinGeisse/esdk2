Removed .data directive since my build system cannot handle it. The text section is mapped to writable memory, so
I don't expect any problems to be caused by that.

The simulator generates test outputs in RVTEST_IO_ASSERT_GPR_EQ which mostly corresponds to what the test thinks is
test output, but the tests seem to have an additional assertion at the beginning to check that x0 is 0. I
removed that assertion in all tests.

TODO:
Using RVTEST_IO_ASSERT_GPR_EQ to generate test output fails in I-SB-01 again...
- generate test output in the _END macro (must be a multiline macro)
- use the preprocessor to eliminate the .data directive automatically
	- unfortunately, this does not work. The preprocessor doesn't like dots in macro names.
