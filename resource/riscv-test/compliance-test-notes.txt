Removed .data directive since my build system cannot handle it. The text section is mapped to writable memory, so
I don't expect any problems to be caused by that.

The simulator generates test outputs in RVTEST_IO_ASSERT_GPR_EQ which mostly corresponds to what the test thinks is
test output, but the tests seem to have an additional assertion at the beginning to check that x0 is 0. I
removed that assertion in all tests.

TODO:
converting the build script to PHP seems to make GCC not use the preprocessor anymore, causing errors.
UPDATE: no, it's not the build script but the fact that the assembler file was named .s and not .S
