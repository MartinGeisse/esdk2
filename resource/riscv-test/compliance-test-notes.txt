Removed .data directive since my build system cannot handle it. The text section is mapped to writable memory, so
I don't expect any problems to be caused by that.

The simulator generates test outputs in RVTEST_IO_ASSERT_GPR_EQ which mostly corresponds to what the test thinks is
test output, but the tests seem to have an additional assertion at the beginning to check that x0 is 0. I
removed that assertion in all tests.

TODO:
Using RVTEST_IO_ASSERT_GPR_EQ to generate test output fails in I-SB-01 again...
- generate test output in the _END macro (must be a multiline macro)
- use the preprocessor to eliminate the .data directive automatically
	- unfortunately, this does not work. The preprocessor doesn't like dots in macro names.


The doc says: .word aligns to word boundary automatically

Tested: ".align N" aligns to (2^N) half-words (= 2^(N+1) bytes). It uses 0 in .data and 0x13 (NOP) in .text section.
    .align 1        # align to half-word
    .align 2        # align to word
    .align 3        # align to double-word
    .align 4        # align to 4 words (one line in objdump output)
