Removed .data directive since my build system cannot handle it. The text section is mapped to writable memory, so
I don't expect any problems to be caused by that.

I generate test outputs in RVTEST_IO_ASSERT_GPR_EQ which mostly corresponds to what the test thinks is test output,
but for example for the ADDI test there was one additional assertion at the beginning, so I had to add that value to
the expected output too.
