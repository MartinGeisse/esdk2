Try to use different subclasses of RtlVectorValue for small (<32, <64) vectors, storing the bits as an int or long.

Demand that *all* small values use these subclasses, i.e. a BitSet is only used for >64. Then no mixed
calculations can occur and we can just cast the "other operand".

Also consider using BigInteger to store vectors instead of BitSet. Many operations have to convert to BigInteger
anyway, and it seems to be more powerful in general.
