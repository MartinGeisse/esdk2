=== The Test Virtual Machine

The test runs in the context of a _Test Virtual Machine_ (TVM) as defined and available at https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests. There will be a different TVM for each instruction subset and each profile.

=== The target environment

A specific target will need to be chosen and setup to run the Test. This can be an Instruction Set Simulator (ISS), full system simulator (emulator), HDL simulator, FPGA prototype, or a board/chip, etc.  The test runs in the context of a TVM and is set up to run on the specific target.  The _target environment_ controls the loading of the test plus TVM onto the target, configures the device if needed, controls the execution, and then extracts the signature.

=== The processor configuration (device configuration)

The RISC-V specification allows many optional instructions, registers, and other features.  Many targets have a fixed selection of these optional items which cannot be changed. For example, a chip is fixed in the mask.  A simulator on the other hand may implement all known options and will need to be constrained to have only the required options available.  There will need to be processor configuration for those target devices which need to be constrained to only reflect the features of the device being compliance tested. This is essential when writing compliance tests to ensure that only available options are used in the tests.

=== The test signature

The _test signature_ is defined as reference data written into memory during the execution of the test.  It should record values and results of the operation of the Test. It is expected that an implementation, at the end of a test, dumps the signature in to a file such that only 4-bytes are written per line, starting with the most-significant byte on the left.

=== The test reference signature

The _test reference signature_ is the _test signature_ saved from an execution run of the RISC‑V _golden model_.  This is currently from a RISC-V ISS, but the intention is that the RISC-V Formal Model from the RISCV.org Formal Working Group will be used when it is complete, functional, and available. 

=== The test suites

Tests are grouped into different functional test suites targeting the different subsets of the full RISC-V specifications.  There will be ISA and privilege suites.

For information on the status of the different test suites, look here: link:../riscv-test-suite/README.md[../riscv-test-suite/README.md]


=== The test framework

This works at several levels.  At the lowest level it runs a test with a TVM on a specific configured target device and compares the test’s output test signature against the test reference signature and reports if there is any difference. A difference indicates that the target has failed that specific compliance test.

The test framework allows different test suites to be run depending on the capabilities of the target

The test framework collates the results of all the Tests that comprise a Test Suite and reports the overall results.

== Test framework

For running compliance tests, the Test Virtual Machine (TVM) “p” available at https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests is utilized.

In addition to using the basic functionality of the TVM, the script for running compliance tests runs the test on the target and then performs comparison of the target’s generated test signature to the manually reviewed test reference signature.

See the chapter below for selecting and setting up the target (simulator, or hardware, etc.).

If using a target that requires the processor to be configured, see the chapter below on processor configuration.

You will also need to have a suitable compiler tool chain (GCC or LLVM) installed in your environment and available on your path.

Tests are run by commands in the top level `Makefile` which has targets for simulate and verify

[source,make]
----
RISCV_TARGET ?= riscvOVPsim
RISCV_DEVICE ?= rv32i
RISCV_PREFIX ?= riscv64-unknown-elf-

simulate:
        make RISCV_TARGET=$(RISCV_TARGET) \
             RISCV_DEVICE=$(RISCV_DEVICE) \
             RISCV_PREFIX=$(RISCV_PREFIX) \
             run -C $(SUITEDIR)

verify:
    riscv-test-env/verify.sh
----

== Setting the target environment

The target environment needs setting up to allow the compliance tests to be run on the target.  This can be used while developing compliance test suites or it can be used with new targets to see if they correctly execute the compliance test suites and are compliant!

This chapter provides information on the currently available targets and includes a short tutorial on how to add a new target.

=== Imperas riscvOVPsim compliance simulator

For tracing the test the following  macros are defined in `riscv-target/riscvOVPsim/compliance_io.h`:

[source,make]
----
RVTEST_IO_INIT
RVTEST_IO_WRITE_STR(_SP, _STR)
RVTEST_IO_ASSERT_GPR_EQ(_SP, _R, _I)
----

An example of a test that uses the tracing macros is `riscv-test-suite/rv32i/ISA/src/I-IO.S`.

To configure the simulator for different target devices there needs to be a Makefile fragment in the `device` directory.

The Makefile fragment for RV32I is in `riscv-target/riscvOVPsim/device/rv32i`

In the top level Makefile there needs to be a selection for the target and device:
[source,make]
----
RISCV_TARGET?=riscvOVPsim
RISCV_DEVICE?=rv32i
----

The path to the RUN_TARGET is defined within the riscv-target Makefile.include.

=== Berkeley Spike ISA simulator
For spike the file `riscv-target/spike/compliance_io.h` has the trace macros defined as empty.  The Makefile fragment in `riscv-target/spike/device/rv32i` has the spike run command for the RV32I device.

=== Berkeley Rocket Chip emulators
Additional environment variables:

* `ROCKET_DIR`: Specifies link:https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip[Rocket Chip] directory. Required.
* `ROCKET_CONFIG`: Specifies Rocket Chip link:https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip/blob/master/src/main/scala/system/Configs.scala[configuration]. **Usually** defaults to `DefaultConfig` or `DefaultRV32Config`, unless the aforementioned configurations do not support a test suite's ISA extensions (for example, in the case of `rv32ud`).

Before running the compliance test, make sure that the correct emulator is built, following the link:https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip#emulator[instructions in the Rocket Chip repository].

**Note**: Rocket Chip's `DefaultRV32Config` is currently failing the following test — link:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-compliance/issues/31[rv32i/I-MISALIGN_JMP-01.S].

=== SiFive RISC-V ISA Formal Specification
Additional environment variables:

* `FORMALSPEC_DIR`: Specifies link:https://github.com/sifive/RiscvSpecFormal[formal specification] directory. Required.

Build the link:https://github.com/sifive/RiscvSpecFormal[formal model] before running compliance tests. The model currently supports `RV32i` with `a`, `c`, and `f` extensions.

**Note**: Some tests in the `rv32i` suite will fail because privileged CSRs are not yet implemented in the formal specification.

=== Adding a new Target

In this section, a short tutorial how to add a user target in the TVM is provided.

If you do not want to use the TVM at all, it is recommended to just take the tests and references and incorporate them into your testing environment.  The only requirement needed in this case is that there must be an option to dump the results from the target in the test environment so as the comparison to test reference signature is possible.

The following steps demonstrate an example in which a target was replaced by Codasip ISA simulator. In a similar way, any RISC-V ISA simulator or any RTL simulation model of the RISC-V processor can be connected.

* Redefine macros in `ISA/src/compliance_test.h` and `binary_coding/src/compliance_test.h`.
+
For example, to support Codasip ISA simulator as Target, it was necessary to redefine `RV_COMPLIANCE_HALT macro`, `RV_COMPLIANCE_DATA_BEGIN` macro and `RV_COMPLIANCE_DATA_END` macro in `ISA/compliance_test.h` in the following way:
+
[source,c]
----
#define RV_COMPLIANCE_HALT
        add     x31, x0, 1
        sw      x31, codasip_syscall, t0
----

* This means that on the address defined by `codasip_syscall`, the 1 value is stored and this is interpreted as `HALT` for the Codasip ISA simulator.
+
[source,c]
----
#define RV_COMPLIANCE_DATA_BEGIN
        .align  4;
        .global codasip_signature_start;
codasip_signature_start:
----
+
[source,c]
----
#define RV_COMPLIANCE_DATA_END
        .align  4;
        .global codasip_signature_end;
codasip_signature_end:
----

* The Codasip ISA simulator dumps data from the addresses bounded by labels `codasip_signature_start` and `codasip_signature_end` to `stdout`.  The dumped data represent the results of the tests.

* Modify Makefiles in `ISA/Makefile` and `binary_coding/Makefile`.  It is important to change tools that are evaluated and parameters that are passed to the tools.
+
For example, to support the Codasip ISA simulator as the device under test
(DUT), it was necessary to change `RISCV_SIM` from `spike` to
`codix_berkelium-ia-isimulator –r` and parameters for running the simulator
from `+signature=$(work_dir)/$<.signature.output` to `–info 5` plus handle
redirection to a file by `1>$(work_dir)/$<.signature.output`.

== Configuring the target device

This section is for how to specify which optional parts are being used

NOTE: This is primarily for simulators.

In the directory `riscv-target/*/device` there are directories that have Makefile fragments that configure the simulator to simulate only those parts of the RISC-V specification that is required for the specific target device being tested.

For example for the riscvOVPsim to be configured to be a RV32I
[source,make]
----
RUN_TARGET= \
        riscvOVPsim.exe --variant RV32I --program $(work_dir_isa)/$< \
            --signaturedump \
            --override riscvOVPsim/cpu/sigdump/SignatureFile=$(work_dir_isa)/$(*).signature.output \
            --override riscvOVPsim/cpu/sigdump/ResultReg=3 \
            --override riscvOVPsim/cpu/simulateexceptions=T \
            --logfile $(work_dir_isa)/$@

[appendix]
== One ISA Test

For a detailed description of one ISA test please have a look at the example: link:../riscv-test-suite/rv32i/src/I-IO.S[`I-IO.S`].

This includes use of all the logging and assertion macros and shows how a test is split into sections.

[appendix]
== Repository structure

The top level directory contains a `README.md` file giving an overview of the project, top level `Makefile`, `ChangeLog`, the `verify.sh` script and complete license files for the Creative Commons and BSD licenses used by the task group.  There are then four top level directories.

`doc`:: All the documentation for the project, written using _AsciiDoc_.

`riscv-target`:: Contains a further subdirectory for each target, within which are placed the `compliance_io.h` header for that target and a `device` directory for all the devices of that target. If the `$TARGETDIR` environment variable is set to another directory, the scripts will search this directory for targets instead.

`riscv-test-env`:: This contains headers common to all environments, and then a directory for each TVM variant, with `link.ld` linker script and `riscv_test.h` header.

`riscv-test-suite`:: This contains a subdirectory for each instruction set or instruction set extension.  Within each subdirectory the source code and reference output for each test are in the `ISA` directory.

`riscv-ovpsim`:: This contains a copy of the Imperas OVP riscvOVPsim simulator for use in compliance testing. It includes a subdirectory of examples with pre-compiled .elf files and has binaries of the simulator for Linux64 and Windows64. This is referenced by the makefiles for developing and running the compliance suites. riscvOVPsim can run all the tracing and assertion macros used in the tests.
